# Texas_Beverage_Revenue-_Network-
Final project for Big Data &amp; Distributed Computing using Apache Spark and Databricks to analyze and visualize Texas permit and tax data. Covers streaming, graph processing, and ML workflows.

# Big Data & Distributed Computing Final Project – Texas Open Data Analysis

This repository contains the final project notebook for the Big Data and Distributed Computing course. The project was implemented using Apache Spark on the Databricks platform and focuses on analyzing open datasets from the Texas government.

## 🎯 Objective

To explore, process, and analyze large-scale datasets from the Texas Open Data Portal and uncover business insights using Spark-based workflows — including graph processing, structured streaming, and machine learning.

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

- **Apache Spark**
- **Databricks**
- **PySpark**
- **GraphFrames**
- **Structured Streaming**
- **MLlib (Spark ML)**
- **Texas Open Data Portal**

## 📦 Datasets

We used large datasets including:
- **Sales Tax Permits**
- **Receipts and Revenue by County**
- **Geographic and Business Entity Data**

Combined dataset size: ~300MB+

## 🧠 Key Features

- Data ingestion and cleaning using Spark
- Revenue analysis by county using `groupBy` and aggregations
- Graph analytics with GraphFrames (e.g., business relationships)
- Structured Streaming mock setup for real-time data simulation
- Machine Learning for permit-based revenue predictions

## 📈 Sample Insights

- Top counties by average revenue
- Common permit-holder patterns and anomalies
- Graph-based connectivity between businesses
- Revenue prediction accuracy using ML models
